Project Title

A web scrapper

Getting started

This is a web scrapper written in python. It is based on beautiful soup to
parse web pages and extract the needed information.
For every website that needs to be parsed a separate scrapper module must
be created in the scrappers folder and with a single line of code in the
app.py file it can easily be added to the output.

Usage

It is a simple website where the user enters the item of interest and a 
compiled list of items gathered from the websites in the scrapper folder is 
on the webpage. For now the items are displayed in ascending order of price.
